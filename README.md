# Ignite Flare
Welcome to Schulich Ignite Flare! This is our advanced sessions meant for people who are already familiar with the basics (variables, if/else, loops, lists, functions) and interested in learning more. If you're looking for our beginner workshops, take a look [here](http://schulichignite.com/beginner/). 

Sessions will be using Python with pygame. Our sessions will be using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our text editor, but feel free to use any text editor you are comfortable with.

## main.py
We will be using our `main.py` file as a template for all the projects in Ignite Flare. Make sure you download this file and keep it in a safe spot, as we will be copying it and using it a few times. This holds some pre-written code that is standard for any project using pygame. You won't need to understand how it works, but we encourage you to try your best to learn how it works anyway!

**This file is under construction, please check back later.**

## Installation guide
Check out our [installation guide](installation_guide.md) for instructions on how to install everything you'll need for our sessions.
We will be covering this guide during our Session 0.
